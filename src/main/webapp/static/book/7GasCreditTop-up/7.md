# <font color=Black>Top-Up Gas Credit</font>

	 
Any Wallet in the Non-Cryptocurrency Public Chains needs to consume Gas Credit when initiating a transaction. For example, if your user want to initiate a transaction, his/her chain Wallet needs to consume Gas Credit. At this time, you can use your NTT balance to Top-up the Gas Credit of this chain Wallet to ensure that the transaction can proceed normally.

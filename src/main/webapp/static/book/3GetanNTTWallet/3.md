When the Data Center Management System interacts with the chain, it needs to use your private key for signing data. Then, your identity and authority will be confirmed. After this configuration, the system will automatically call your private key to sign data when needed. The private key will be kept in your local key store. All operations requiring the private key are also performed locally.

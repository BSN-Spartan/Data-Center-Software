# <font color=Black>Get an NTT Wallet</font>


Different from the normal Default Chain Wallet, an NTT Wallet refers to the only wallet address owned by the Data Center on the BSN Spartan Network that is capable of using NTT or obtaining NTT incentives.


The Spartan NTT contract upgrades the ordinary Default Chain wallet to an NTT wallet by authorizing it. To get a NTT Wallet, you need a Default Chain wallet at first, here are several ways to get a wallet address and the corresponding private key ***<font color=red>(Never disclose your private key to others. The private key corresponding to each wallet is generated by a cryptographic algorithm and cannot be changed.)</font>***

If you already have a private key generated by the secp256k1 algorithm and its corresponding wallet address, such as an Ethereum wallet address, you can use the wallet address directly.

## <font color=Black>Use MetaMask</font>
---

You can download MetaMask here and create an account for free. The account address in MetaMask can be used as a Wallet Address, and the corresponding private key is the same.	


In Spartan Non-Cryptocurrency Public Chains, an Wallet Address is a Gas Credit receiving address, which is a unique sequence of hexadecimal numbers.

## <font color=Black>Private Key Configuration</font>
---
	
When the Data Center Management System interacts with the chain, it needs to use your private key for signing data. Then, your identity and authority will be confirmed. After this configuration, the system will automatically call your private key to sign data when needed. The private key will be kept in your local key store. All operations requiring the private key are also performed locally.

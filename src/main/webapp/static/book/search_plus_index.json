The Spartan NTT contract upgrades the ordinary Default Chain wallet to an NTT wallet by authorizing it. To get a NTT Wallet, you need a Default Chain wallet at first, here are several ways to get a wallet address and the corresponding private key (Never disclose your private key to others. The private key corresponding to each wallet is generated by a cryptographic algorithm and cannot be changed.) An Existing secp256k1 Wallet Address If you already have a private key generated by the secp256k1 algorithm and its corresponding wallet address, such as an Ethereum wallet address, you can use the wallet address directly. Use MetaMask You can download MetaMask here and create an account for free. The account address in MetaMask can be used as a Wallet Address, and the corresponding private key is the same. In Spartan Non-Cryptocurrency Public Chains, an Wallet Address is a Gas Credit receiving address, which is a unique sequence of hexadecimal numbers. Private Key Configuration When the Data Center Management System interacts with the chain, it needs to use your private key for signing data. Then, your identity and authority will be confirmed.

Don't see your question answered here? Then please contact us. Why a default node is required? Data center management system needs to interact with the Default Chain (SpartanI) in order to obtain data directly from chain, and the node is the key to access the chain. Please make sure this node is successfully deployed before deploying the data center management system. What is an NTT? A Non-Tradable Token (NTT) is a digital token that is issued on the default chain of the BSN Spartan Network. Each BSN Spartan data center has only one registered NTT wallet to manage and hold NTT, which can be purchased with fiat currency or designated stablecoins or acquired through incentive programs. NTT can be used to purchase Gas Credits on any NC Public Chain of the BSN Spartan Network. NTT can neither be traded nor transferred between data centers. What is an NTT Wallet? As a special Default Chain wallet, the NTT Wallet refers to the only wallet address owned by the Virtual Data Center operator on the BSN Spartan Network, which can be used to purchase Gas Credits with NTT or receive NTT incentives. What is a Wallet Address? In Spartan Non-Cryptocurrency Public Chains, an Wallet Address is a Gas Credit receiving address, which is a unique sequence of hexadecimal numbers. Why Private Key Configuration is required? The private key is usually a sequence of 64-bit hexadecimal numbers which is used to make data signature for transactions. In order to facilitate the user without repeatedly entering the private key, in the data center management system, an 8-16 digits password is set to configure the private key to the user's local server. When submitting transactions to the chain, users can directly use this password instead of a complex private key. What is a Private Key? A private key is a secret number that is used in cryptography, similar to a password. In cryptocurrency, private keys are also used to sign transactions and prove ownership of a blockchain address. What is a Virtual Data Center? A Virtual Data Center is a set of locally installed software systems that contains one or more registered full nodes of different NC Public Chains. Each Virtual Data Center has one NTT wallet and is eligible to receive Node Establishment and Data Center Monthly Incentives. What is the Node Establishment Incentive Program? When a new node successfully registered to the BSN Spartan Network, a fixed amount of NTT will be given to the Data Center as an incentive. If the incentive amount for a given Non-cryptocurrency Public Chain needs to be changed, a consensus vote will be initiated. The incentive amount will be updated if a certain percentage of consensus parties agree. These incentive NTT will be directly minted to the NTT Wallet of the data center. What is the Data Center Monthly Incentive Program? For Spartan, as an infrastructure network, its task is to provide Data Center users with infrastructure that can carry their own services. The only criterion for measuring whether Spartan is doing well or not is how many services are based on it. Therefore, Spartan needs a mechanism to motivate more Data Centers to use it to complete more practical services. Incentive Level Gas Credit Consumption(NTT) in Previous Month Progressive Loyalty NTT Ratio Tier 1 0 - Nodesubsidy 100% Tier 2 Nodesubsidy - 3000 60% Tier 3 3000 - 20000 40% Tier 4 20000 - 100000 20% Tier 5 More than 100000 10% [!danger|style:flat] The value of Nodesubsidy is based on the number of nodes that the Data Center is running, and the nodes' health status. Why Data Center ID and Token Configuration is required? The user’s Data Center ID and Token will be required when the Data Center Management System interacts with the Data Center management smart contracts on the Default Chain. And it will be also required for calling some Spartan official smart contracts. What is the Gas Credit? In a similar fashion to cryptocurrencies, Gas Credits are used as a means of paying the Gas fee on NC Public Chains. However, Gas Credits cannot be transferred between standard wallets. Only the data center operator 's NTT wallet can be used to purchase Gas Credits with NTT. How Emergency Gas Credit Top-Up Works? When your NTT Wallet balance cannot complete a normal Top-up transaction, you can use the Emergency Gas Credit Top-up to consume your NTT to Top-up the Gas Credit of your NTT Wallet once. Instead of using the Gas Credit of the given NTT wallet, emergency gas credit top-up will use a wallet top-uped in advance by the foundation to pay for the Gas Credit required for the transaction. So there are restrictions on the frequency of use and it can be only use to top-up the given NTT Wallet itself. What is the Node Registration Test? The Spartan Governance System will send multiple requests at fixed intervals to the testing node to query the current block height. If the difference between the block height information returned by the node and the consensus block height is less than a certain range, then the node will pass the test. If after a certain number of requests, the block height information returned by the node still has a large gap with the consensus block height, then the test will fail. Does the data center management system collect user data? The Data Center Management System will not collect any information and data of users in any way. All the information configured by the user is stored locally, all data exchange behaviors of the Data Center Management System are directly interacted with the chain, the submitted data will be directly uploaded to the chain, and the data used for display is obtained by parsing events from the chain or from local database. Data Center Management System are open source, and users can compile and deploy the system by themselves.

# <font color=Black>Deploy Full Node of Default Chain (Spartan-I Chain)</font>


A full node is required to provide interaction with the Default Chain of Spartan Network (Spartan-I Chain), otherwise your local Data Center Management System cannot access the data on Spartan Network and cannot submit transactions.


To install the node, you need to get the deploy resources first.

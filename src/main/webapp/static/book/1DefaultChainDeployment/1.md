# <font color=Black>Deploy Full Node of Default Chain (Spartan-I Chain) </font>


A full node is required to provide interaction with the Default Chain of Spartan Network (Spartan-I Chain), otherwise your local Data Center Management System cannot access the data on Spartan Network and cannot submit transactions.


To become a Data Center you need to install the node in your local system first.
